## Introduction 
<h4>Digital Music has become increasingly popular since the turn of the 21st Century. Not only has music become digitized, but creating music has also become increasing accessible. Owning a guitar is no longer needed to create beautiful melodies. Instead anyone with access to a laptop can create digital music. There are many software packages available to make creating digital music simple. In our project we will be using Sonic Pi to create digital music. From Wikipedia: Sonic Pi is a live coding environment based on Ruby, originally designed to support both computing and music lessons in schools, developed by Sam Aaron in the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory in collaboration with Raspberry Pi Foundation. The Raspberry Pi operating system supports Sonic Pi and can be installed on it, so that is what we will be using for our purposes.<h4>
